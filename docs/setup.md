# Setup

This document describes the easiest path to set up for this class.  You are welcome to stray from it, but know that it will be harder for the instructors to troubleshoot.

## Windows

For web development that doesn't use .NET, you will be much happier running Linux.  The easiest way to do so is by setting up a virtual machine (VM).  You will need to:

1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org)
1. Download [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com) Desktop 32-bit
1. [Install Ubuntu](http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/virtualbox)

## Mac

Install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh).  Unless otherwise specified, you will install command-line tools using `brew install PACKAGE`.

## Linux

If you are in Ubuntu, run `sudo apt-get update`, or the equivalent command to get the latest packages in other distributions.  You will install packages using `sudo apt-get install PACKAGE`.

## All

Great, now that you're in a Unix-y environment, go ahead and install:

* Git & GitHub
  * Follow [these installation instructions](https://training.github.com/articles/github-class-prerequisites/)
* Ruby 2.x.x, using [RVM](https://rvm.io)
* [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3), or editor of choice (contact one of the instructors if you want a license for [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/))
